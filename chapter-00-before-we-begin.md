# Before we begin...

George: Before we begin, brief introductions are in order...

Micaela: Nice to meet y'all. I'm Micaela and instead of me telling you about myself, I'd like to tell you a bit about George. 

George: Wait what?

Micaela: Yeah, come on, George, let's try a little experiment. You know me, I hate boring so instead of a typical bio and list of accomplishments, we can introduce one another. What do you think?

George: Huh, ok let's try it. It worked out with the Bitmoji's.

Micaela: I'll go first, if that's cool?

George: Yep.

Micaela: I first met George when we were both coaching two different teams. These two teams had different missions and a different culture but needed to work together toward the same goal. We had our first meeting and immediately we just clicked. It was an instant connection and we knew that we were a force to be reckoned with.

Keep in mind our company is huge. I mean seriously gigantic and we were not in the same organization, so when the teams we were coaching finally achieved their goals, on time, and the process worked better than they expected, of course, because we're awesome like that...but I digress. Now where was I? Oh right, it was time for us each to move on to help other teams now that the project was complete. While we each went back to supporting our resepective groups we stayed connected, sharing information about all things agile, books we've read, etc. Eventually, an opening on George's team came up and I jumped at the opportunity and applied for the position. Obviously, I got the job.

Between the two of us, collectively, we have roughly 40 years of experience helping individuals and teams learn how to get things done. Since we joined forces, we have transformed the culture of key areas in our organization. Along the way we have also had an opportunity to get to know one another personally and formed a friendship, in addition to our professional awesomeness. 

George is a software engineer who is a fun, charismatic, storyteller who loves to play guitar with his band. He is a wonderful husband and father who clearly enjoys both of these roles. George is happiest when others are happy and feeling good about what they are doing. Like me, George, is an enthusiastic agilist (yes I know, I'm making up words) who has used the underlying and philosophical aspect of agile and agile's practices and principles at home. He has a kanban board for chores, homework, activities, etc. and we have exchanged tips and tricks on how each of us uses our own boards and agile practices like retros and daily scrums. 

This latest collaboration, "Agile All the Things", was born out of our many exchanges on how you really can use various Agile techniques, from Scrum to Kanban, Lean to peer programming (seriously works well for getting laundry and dishes done) in areas that have nothing to do with software or even technology. 

George: Wow, Micaela thanks for that. Ok now it's my turn. Micaela is a mother of two, a dogmom to two, a wife to one, and a coach to many. If you've seen her LinkedIn profile you probably have seen her personal motto, "Transforming the world, one iteration at a time." She really believes that and lives by that motto every day. 

Micaela's life ambition is to make the world better by helping others become their best selves. She uses her experience as an Agile Coach, Leadership Coach and Storyteller and Speaker to coach, teach and inspire others to embrace the adventure that begins when they move beyond their comfort zone. 

Micaela has covered most of how we met and why we started this collaboration, but there are a couple things to add. 

Thing one - she called it an exchange, but I would characterize it as closer to venting. As such I would suggest that our mutual revelation was born out of frustration (as the best revelations usually are).

Thing two - we also realized that many of the things we were doing with teams at work suddenly made sense to do with our own (respective) families. Oh, it also dawned on us that some of the things that made sense with our kids might just help us at work. (Please don’t tell anyone that). Oh wait we just did, in a book that we hope will sell millions of copies...

Micaela: Uh George, did you get lost in imagining how many happy people will be able to apply this book to their lives?

George: Huh, oh yeah, right. Right, yes. We realized that we were embodying Work / life balance of a different sort. Of an Agile sort. We started to refer to it as Agile All the Things, which, for those of you don't know, comes from a meme based on a blog written by <FILL IN NAME HERE>

Oh, almost forgot. If you care about these kind of things, we’re both Certified Scrum Masters, Certified Scrum Product Owners, Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Master and Scrum Product Owner, a Certified Blue Core Coach, a Certified Scrum at Scale Professional and a few other certifications kicking around. So, the certification people have vouched that we know what we’re doing. We’ll back up those credentials with things we’ve learned working with teams of all sizes and how we’re applying what we’re learning to all kinds of every day situations.

So, with that out of the way, it’s time to Agile All the Things...
