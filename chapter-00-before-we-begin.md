# Before we begin...

Before we begin, a brief introduction is in order...

George is a father of two, a husband to one, and a coach to many. A guitar player, software engineer, and fixer of things.

Micaela is a mother of two, a wife to one, and a coach to many. <NEED-INPUT-MICAELA>

We work together. Between the two of us we’ve worked in a variety of Development, Test, Design, and Product roles for over 40 years. <NEED-INPUT-MICAELA>

We met at work. The odds were against it, the company we work for is massive, but one day we found ourselves face to face on a video call. There were two teams in two organizations that had been tasked with working together on a new thing. Each of us had been helping the other team and it was immediately apparent that when we worked together, we were a force to be reckoned with. A little while later we joined forces officially and we’ve been helping people get things done ever since. On any given day, we’re helping teams and their leaders with technical, process, or cultural challenges. 

A while back, we had a revelation that was born out of frustration (as the best revelations usually are).

We realized that many of the things we were doing with teams at work suddenly made sense to do with our own (respective) kids. Oh, it also dawned on us that some of the things that made sense with our kids might just help us at work. (Please don’t tell anyone that).

Work / life balance of a different sort.

Oh, almost forgot. If you care about these kind of things, we’re both Certified Scrum Masters, Certified Scrum Product Owners, a Certified Scrum at Scale Professional and a few other certifications kicking around. So, the certification people have vouched that we know what we’re doing. We’ll back up those credentials with things we’ve learned working with teams of all sizes and how we’re applying what we’re learning to all kinds of every day situations.

So, with that out of the way, it’s time to Agile All the Things...
