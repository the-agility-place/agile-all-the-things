#Bottlenecks

We moved into a brand new building a few years ago. Open office, sit/stand adjustable desks, movable whiteboard walls that we used to make neighborhoods. Everything was shiny and new. This included the coffee machine.

The coffee machine was new to us, different kind than we had previously, and as a result, each and every morning there was a massive line as person after person struggled to make their drinks. 

That line should have gone away as soon as people got used to the new machine, right?

It didn’t. Every single morning, there continued to be a line.

That’s when I realized we were seeing the exact same thing that we see on our boards.
