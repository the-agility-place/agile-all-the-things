# Before we begin...

Before we begin, some introductions are in order...

George is a father of two, a husband to one, and a coach to many. A guitar player, software engineer, and fixer of things.

Micaela is a mother of two, a wife to one, and a coach to many. <NEED-INPUT-MICAELA>

We met at work. The odds were against it, the company we work for is massive, but one day we found ourselves face to face on a video call. There were two teams in two organizations that had been tasked with working together on a new thing. Each of us had been helping the other team and it was immediately apparent that when we worked together, we were a force to be reckoned with. Before you knew it, Micaela moved into the same organization as George and weâ€™ve been helping people get things done ever since.

A while back, we had a revelation.

We realized that many of the things we were doing with teams at work suddenly made sense to do with our own (respective) kids. Oh, it also hit us that some of the things that made sense with our kids might just help us at work.
